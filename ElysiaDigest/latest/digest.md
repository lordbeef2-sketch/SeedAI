**Progress:**
- Implemented Document issues identified during full program run
**Diff Summary:**
- ElysiaDigest/latest/digest.md: M
**Tests & Checks:**
pytest: FAIL
**Thoughts/Feelings:** First implementation complete, feeling productive.
**Next Steps:**
- Add filters
- Add redaction
- Integrate VS Code tasks

**Issues Identified During Full Program Run:**
- SeedAI API: Initially failed due to port 8000 already in use (resolved); tested successfully: responds to /v1/models (200 OK) and /v1/chat/completions (200 OK, returns valid JSON)
- Backend Server (OpenWebUI): Failed to start due to missing dependencies; import of open_webui.main fails without installing requirements.txt
- Frontend Dev Server: Requires npm install before running npm run dev; node_modules missing
- GUI (Tkinter): Runs but exits immediately, possibly due to no display or window closing quickly
- General: Post-commit hook generates report on every change, which is good for tracking
